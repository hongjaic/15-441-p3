1) One vulnerability that our system has, and did not find the time to fix is
that when data packets are being transmitted, and the sending side goes down,
the receiving side might not get the complete file.

2) Another vulnerability is the down node detection. In our system, a node is
assumed to be down after 10 data packet retramissions, or 3 none-data packet
retransmission. This does good job in most cases, but sometimes would make a
node assume that another node is down. Our system (like all other systems)
would work the best in good internet conditions.
